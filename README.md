<h1>YouTube Downloader</h1>

My first personal python project. Written to be used with pyinstaller.

Was getting the keyerror 'cipher', fixed this by editing the extract.py file in python library files on my pc.
Now all everything is downloading but the resolution isn't great and the filename is just set to YouTube.
So need to work on a fix for this.
