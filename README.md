<h1>YouTube Downloader</h1>

My first personal python project. Written to be used with pyinstaller.

Updated so that you can name the file yourself.
Downloads folder created in CWD.

Was getting the keyerror 'cipher', fixed this by editing the extract.py file in pytube files, thanks wspek, here's a link to his comment that I followed https://github.com/nficano/pytube/issues/661#issuecomment-656283853 .
